# lyftTest
This is my Lyft sample code

This app:
- accepts a POST request to the route “/test”, which accepts one argument “string_to_cut”

- returns a JSON object with the key “return_string” and a string containing every third letter from the original string


DEAR LYFT FRIENDS:

Since the time I applied to the SWE apprenticeship, I deployed my first CRUD app. Please check it out here:
